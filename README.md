# Watermark

This is a simple project which shows how to efficiently watermark a Video using AVKit.  It also shows how to wrap older completion handler based code with async await.

This code also relates to the Stack Overflow Q&A:
- [Watermarking a Video](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75405029/2715565)

and leverages the Ray Wenderlich  materials:
- [Kodeco.com](https://www.kodeco.com/6236502-avfoundation-tutorial-adding-overlays-and-animations-to-videos)

See the documentation for `exportIt` in the code base for its use and performance.
